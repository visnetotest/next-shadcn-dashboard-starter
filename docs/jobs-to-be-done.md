# Jobs to be Done Analysis - Next.js Admin Dashboard

## Overview
This document analyzes the Next.js Admin Dashboard template through the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework, identifying the core jobs, outcomes, and scenarios that users aim to accomplish.

## Core Job Statements

### Developer Job Statement
*When I need to build an admin dashboard quickly,
I want to use a production-ready template with modern features,
So I can focus on business logic rather than building common dashboard components from scratch.*

### Admin Job Statement
*When I need to manage my application's resources and monitor performance,
I want an intuitive and feature-rich dashboard interface,
So I can efficiently handle administrative tasks and make data-driven decisions.*
